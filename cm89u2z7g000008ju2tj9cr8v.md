This tutorial will guide you through integrating [Supabase](https://supabase.com?ref=dedevs) with a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org?ref=dedevs) application. You will learn how to set up a database with sample data and perform efficient queries.

Supabase is an open-source backend as a service (BaaS) that offers developers robust tools such as real-time databases, authentication, file storage, and more, all without the need for a separate backend server.

* Establish and configure a Supabase project.
    
* Set up a Next.js application pre-configured with Supabase.
    
* Configure environment variables and perform queries on your database within your application.
    

### Now, let's dive into it step by step!

---

## Why Supabase?

Supabase empowers developers by simplifying backend processes with its multitude of features, such as:

1. **PostgreSQL-backed database management:** Add, query, and manage relational data.
    
2. **Serverless functionality:** Powered by SQL and APIs, no backend coding required.
    
3. **Real-time updates:** Reflect changes instantly across connected clients.
    
4. **Authentication and Authorization:** Built-in user management tools for seamless security.
    
5. **Storage options:** Manage file uploads and delivery.
    

> Whether you're building a new application or enhancing an existing project, Supabase reduces development time while ensuring scalable backend functionality.

# <mark>Step-by-Step: Supabase on NextJS</mark>

> #### **Build your very own Supabase‚Äôd NextJS Application in minutes by following these 5 steps.**

## <mark>Step 1: Create Supabase Project</mark>

Get started with Supabase by navigating to [database.new](http://database.new) and creating a new project. Once your project is running, navigate to the **Table Editor** inside the Supabase dashboard to create a new table. You can also run some SQL commands to set up a table with sample data.  
  
**SQL script to create an** `instruments` **table with sample data**

```sql
-- Create the 'instruments' table  
create table instruments (
    id bigint primary key generated always as identity,
    name text not null
);

-- Insert sample data into the table  
insert into instruments (name)  
values  
('violin'),  
('viola'),  
('cello');

-- Enable Row-Level Security for the table  
alter table instruments enable row level security;
  
-- Make the table publicly readable  
create policy "public can read instruments"  
on public.instruments  
for select  
to anon  
using (true);
```

* Creates a table named `instruments` with `id` and `name` columns.
    
* Inserts three sample entries: **violin**, **viola**, and **cello**.
    
* Sets up row-level security so only authenticated users have access.
    
* Adds a policy allowing public ‚Äúread-only‚Äù access to the instrument data.
    

## <mark>Step 2: Create Next.js App Pre-configured with Supabase</mark>

Next, let‚Äôs create a Next.js app. You can use the Supabase template to set up a pre-configured project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and cookie-based auth. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ü™Ñ</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Automagically generates folder structure of your app with Supabase support baked in.</div>
</div>

## <mark>Step 3: Declare Supabase Environment Variables</mark>

Once your project is ready, you need to add Supabase configuration to your app, then simply rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` in your project root directory | `cp .env.example .env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Populate `.env.local` with your **Supabase Project URL** and **Anon Key** found in your Supabase dashboard.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>
```

## <mark>Step 4: Query Data from Supabase in Next.js App</mark>

**Create file at** `app/instruments/page.tsx` **and add the following code to fetch data from the** `instruments` **table using Supabase's JavaScript SDK and render it on the page:**

```tsx
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server';

export default async function Instruments() {
    // Initialize Supabase client
    const supabase = createClient();

    // Fetch data from the instruments table
    const { data: instruments } = await supabase.from("instruments").select();

    // Render the data
    return <pre>{JSON.stringify(instruments, null, 2)}</pre>;
}
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Queries <code>instruments</code> table and displays fetched JSON data. Style it or pass into components.</div>
</div>

## <mark>Step 5: Start Next.js Application</mark>

```bash
yarn && # install dependencies
yarn dev # start dev server on localhost
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/instruments`](http://localhost:3000/instruments) in your browser. You should see the list of instruments (`violin`, `viola`, `cello`) rendered on the page.

## Next Steps

Now that you‚Äôve successfully set up Supabase and integrated it into your Next.js app, here are some suggestions for what to explore next:

* **Authentication:** Add user signup/login functionality to secure different parts of your app.
    
* **Data Management:** Insert, update, and delete rows directly from your Next.js app.
    
* **File Storage:** Use Supabase Storage to upload and serve assets like images, videos, or documents.
    
* **Custom APIs:** Extend functionality using Supabase Edge Functions or integrate with third-party tools.
    
* **Deployment**: We recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home?ref=dedevs) to deploy your app online.
    
    1. **Log in to Vercel**: connect your repository, and select your project.
        
    2. **Deploy to Vercel**: review and adjust settings if needed, then click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù.
        
        * Vercel will build and deploy your app, giving you a live URL to share or test.
            
        * **Benefits include**: database integrations, the ability to seamlessly connect to custom domains, and serverless functions to enhance your development workflow.
